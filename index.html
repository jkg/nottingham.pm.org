        <h1>Welcome to Nottingham.pm</h1>

	<div class="alert alert-info">
	<p><strong>Latest News:</strong> We have now confirmed our first technical meeting, at Antenna on Beck St, from 19.00 on the 23rd October 2014. Come along and hear the following talks...</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Smoking the Onion (Tales from CPANTesters) &mdash; Barbie</li>
		<li>What do you mean, you can't do $X in Perl 6? &mdash; Matthew Walton</li>
		<li>An Introduction to Catalyst and API creation &mdash; Richard Newsham</li>
	</ul>
	</div>

		<p>Welcome to the Nottingham Perl Mongers group. We're a group of people united by a common interest in the Perl programming language, among other things. We meet up each month and talk about Perl, or other things that interest us ... ok, mostly it's other things that interest us. :-)</p>
		<p>Nominally the group exists to promote interest in, and support users of, Perl, but we're about the furthest thing from an advocacy group you can imagine. Mostly we're just a bunch of friendly people with some shared interests who get together for a chat once in a while.

		<h2>Get In Touch</h2>
		<p>In addition to this website, we have a mailing list kindly hosted by pm.org. You can read about it and subscribe at <a href="http://mail.pm.org/mailman/listinfo/nottingham-pm">http://mail.pm.org/mailman/listinfo/nottingham-pm</a> &mdash; there are also archives, visible to subscribers. Alternatively you can come find us on IRC (<a href="http://www.irc.perl.org/">irc.perl.org</a>, #nottingham.pm), via our Twitter account, <a href="http://twitter.com/nottinghamperl">@nottinghamperl</a>, or find us on <a href='https://www.facebook.com/groups/680516312005636/'>Facebook</a>. </p>

		<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
		<p>We usually meet socially once a month in central Nottingham. The first arrivals are usually from 7, but we're usually there until late on so don't feel you have to rush in for 7. Unless you're bringing the camel, then you should probably get a move on.</p>
			<p>Our next meeting will be a technical one, on <strong>Thursday, October 23rd 2014</strong> at Antenna on Beck Street. We have three speakers lined up; feel free to arrive from 7pm, and we'll look to start the talks from 7.30pm. We should finish up by 9pm, at which point we'll decamp to a local pub to discuss what we've heard.</p>
		<p>These technical meetings will hopefully be a regular fixture! They are not as scary and intimidating as they sound, but rather a less alcohol-centric environment, in which those who wish to present a short talk (anything from 5 minutes to 50 minutes) to other interested Perl geeks can do so &mdash; maybe to drum up interest in a project, to dry-run a talk intended for a larger audience, or just to share something cool they've learned or been working with recently. Venues and dates are still being worked out, details will be available here once confirmed &mdash; for the most up-to-date news, you may prefer to join the mailing list or IRC channel, or find us on Twitter (see above).</p>
		<p>In November we'll have another social meeting at the Canalhouse, our usual haunt ... then we'll break for Christmas, and hopefully be back with another tech event, with some more speakers, in January :-)</p>
		<p>We now have an ical calendar for upcoming events <a href='https://www.google.com/calendar/ical/5aqjb1q630vte00djj2edg5bjo%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics'>Get it here</a> </p>

		<h2>Past Events</h2>
		<p>We've been meeting socially since around July 2013, and have pretty much settled on a stable date. Usually there are 4-6 Perl-geeks and 1 camel around a table, and conversation ranges across every topic ... except Perl :-) We often meet at the Canalhouse, but we're open to branching out and trying new venues &mdash; maybe even (gasp) away from the city centre. Pubs with quality real ale, no loud music, and a decent chance of getting enough tables on a Thursday night are strongly preferred!</p>
		<p>If you want to know more, come and join us :-)</p>
